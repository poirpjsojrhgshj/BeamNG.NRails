"""The ground under a surface model: buildings and tree stands taken out of a DSM (2026-10-15).

Outside the national lidar models Mapterhorn's elevation is Copernicus GLO-30, a surface model: a city block
stands 5-25 m above its streets (Mexico City's Zocalo, a flat square, read 9-20 m below the blocks around it;
roads graded into the ground ran in trenches and the square was a pit), and Botafogo's beach stood several
metres up beside its towers. A morphological opening (the lowest surface a window of WINDOW_M can reach from
below) keeps the terrain's shapes wider than the window and cuts what is narrower: a block between streets,
a building, a small stand of trees. What it cuts beyond a threshold (higher on slopes, where a narrow ridge or
knoll is real) is taken off, softly at its edge; larger forests and whole hills stay as they are.
