"""Duty-cycle pacing for the server's background analyses (2026-10-13).

The game's rendering is very sensitive to memory bandwidth: one numpy thread streaming large arrays made
its shadow pass 5-6x slower (3.4 -> 19 ms), a pure CPU loop changed nothing (in-game, the server frozen
for the comparison). The colour-seam and de-shadow analyses (colormatch.py, deshadow.py) are exactly that
kind of work: ~24 s per region, region after region while the player explores, and they doubled the
game's frame cost in ~15 s bursts (in-game 2026-10-13, the cycle stopped with the server frozen). Their
results are cached per region forever, so they can take longer: a thread that calls enable(duty) sleeps
at its pace() calls whenever it has been busy for SLICE_S, so that it runs at most `duty` of the time.

pace() is a no-op on threads that did not enable pacing (the tile and block builds share some of these
functions and keep full speed).
